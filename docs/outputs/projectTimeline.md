- [ ] **US-003:** System identifies banned/restricted cards
- [ ] **US-004:** System shows legality by format
- [ ] Complete integration between frontend, backend and instrumentation
- [ ] Performance: < 100ms UI response, < 100ms API response
- [ ] Basic integration with Scryfall/Gatherer APIs

### **Sprint 2: Performance Analysis (2-3 weeks)**
**Objective:** Add deep analysis capabilities for deck optimization.

**User Stories Included:**
- **US-005: Mana Curve Analysis** (Priority: Medium)
  - Analyze mana cost distribution (CMC)
  - Generate mana curve visualization
  - Provide balance recommendations

- **US-006: Mana Base Analysis** (Priority: Medium)
  - Analyze land composition and mana sources
  - Identify color consistency issues
  - Calculate ideal land distribution by color

- **US-007: Mana Base Improvements Suggestions** (Priority: Medium)
  - Provide specific card recommendations
  - Suggest improvements based on color analysis
  - Consider user budget and format

- **US-008: Card Grouping by Type** (Priority: Medium)
  - Organize cards by type (creatures, instants, etc.)
  - Show type distribution and balance
  - Provide deck structure analysis

**Sprint Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] System generates visual mana curve analysis
- [ ] System provides mana base recommendations
- [ ] System groups and analyzes cards by type
- [ ] System suggests actionable improvements
- [ ] UI shows analysis in a clear and understandable way

### **Sprint 3: Import/Export and Polish (1-2 weeks)**
**Objective:** Improve user experience with import/export features.

**User Stories Included:**
- **US-009: MTG Arena Format Import** (Priority: Medium)
  - Parse standard MTG Arena format
  - Automatically separate main deck and sideboard
  - Validate cards during import

- **US-010: MTGO Format Import** (Priority: Medium)
  - Parse Magic: The Gathering Online format
  - Handle variations in card names
  - Automatically identify sideboard sections

- **US-011: Deck List Export** (Priority: Low)
  - Export in standard "4x CardName" format
  - Provide multiple export formats
  - Copy to clipboard functionality

**Sprint Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] System correctly imports from MTG Arena
- [ ] System correctly imports from MTGO
- [ ] System exports in multiple formats
- [ ] Smooth user experience without errors
- [ ] Data validation during import/export
