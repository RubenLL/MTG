# US-007: Mana Base Improvement Suggestions

## Objective
Provide specific and actionable recommendations to optimize the deck's mana base.

## Functional Description
As an MTG player, I want to receive specific suggestions on how to improve my mana base, including which specific cards to add or remove, to increase the consistency and performance of my deck.

## Inputs and Outputs

**Inputs:**
- Current mana base analysis
- Problems identified in the analysis
- Approximate budget and deck format
- Play style preferences

**Outputs:**
- Prioritized list of recommendations
- Specific cards suggested to add
- Cards that could be removed
- Expected impact explanation for each change
- Approximate cost of suggested improvements
- Links to cards on Gatherer/Scryfall

## Validation Logic
1. Based on identified problems:
   - **Color screw:** Suggest more lands of the main color
   - **Color imbalance:** Recommend rebalancing dual lands
   - **Mana flood/drought:** Adjust land vs non-land ratio
   - **Budget constraints:** Prioritize cost-effective improvements
2. Consider format context:
   - **Standard:** Modern dual lands and shock lands
   - **Modern:** Fetch lands and shock lands
   - **Commander:** ABUR dual lands and utility lands
   - **Budget:** Recommend economical alternatives
3. Evaluate impact of each suggestion:
   - Probability of improving consistency
   - Implementation cost
   - Acquisition difficulty
4. Provide alternatives for different budgets and availability
